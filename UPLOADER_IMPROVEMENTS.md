# 📦 Uploader.py - Improved Using uploader1.py Reference

## ✅ Changes Made

I've completely rewritten `uploader.py` using the cleaner pattern from `uploader1.py` while keeping offline functionality.

---

## 🔄 What Changed

### **1. Simplified Upload Method**

**Based on uploader1.py pattern:**

```python
# OLD (complex):
def _upload_post(self, filepath):
    # Complex logic
    
def run_forever(self):
    # Inline upload code

# NEW (clean, like uploader1.py):
def upload_single(self, filepath: str) -> bool:
    """Upload single file with retry logic (from uploader1.py)."""
    
    # Validation (from uploader1.py)
    if not os.path.exists(filepath):
        return False
    
    # Size check (from uploader1.py)
    if file_size > 15MB:
        return False
    
    # Retry loop (from uploader1.py)
    attempts = 0
    while attempts < MAX_RETRIES:
        try:
            # Upload with multipart
            files = {field_name: (filename, file, "image/jpeg")}
            response = requests.post(endpoint, files=files, timeout=30)
            
            # Check 200 response (from uploader1.py)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                # Parse Location from JSON (from uploader1.py)
                location = response.json().get("Location")
                return True
        
        except RequestException:
            # Retry logic (from uploader1.py)
            attempts += 1
            if attempts < MAX_RETRIES:
                sleep(RETRY_DELAY)
    
    return False
```

### **2. Field Name Changed**

**From uploader1.py:**
```python
files = {"singleFile": (filename, file, "image/jpeg")}
```

**Applied to uploader.py:**
```python
self.field_name = field_name or "singleFile"  # Defaults to "singleFile"
```

### **3. Retry Logic from uploader1.py**

**Pattern from uploader1.py:**
```python
attempts = 0
while attempts < MAX_RETRIES:
    try:
        upload()
        if success:
            return True
    except:
        pass
    
    attempts += 1
    if attempts < MAX_RETRIES:
        sleep(RETRY_DELAY)

return False  # All retries failed
```

**Now used in uploader.py!**

### **4. Better Error Messages**

**From uploader1.py style:**
```python
print(f"[UPLOADER] ✓ Uploaded: filename")
print(f"[UPLOADER] ✗ Upload failed: HTTP 500")
print(f"[UPLOADER] ⚠ Connection error")
```

Clearer, consistent logging!

## ➕ Offline Features KEPT

While simplifying based on uploader1.py, I kept these essential features:

✅ **Internet connectivity check** (every 60s)
✅ **Offline mode detection**
✅ **Auto-retry when online**
✅ **Statistics tracking**
✅ **Background thread processing**

**Best of both worlds!**

## 📊 Comparison

| Feature | uploader1.py | Old uploader.py | NEW uploader.py |
|---------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Upload method** | Simple, clear | Complex | Simple ✅ |
| **Retry logic** | Built-in | External | Built-in ✅ |
| **Field name** | "singleFile" | "file" | "singleFile" ✅ |
| **Timeout** | 30s | 20s | 30s ✅ |
| **Error handling** | Clean | Verbose | Clean ✅ |
| **Offline detection** | No | Yes | Yes ✅ |
| **Auto-retry** | No | Yes | Yes ✅ |
| **Statistics** | No | Yes | Yes ✅ |
| **Background thread** | No | Yes | Yes ✅ |

**Result:** Simpler code + powerful features!

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### **1. Cleaner Code Structure**

**Before:**
- Mixed inline upload logic
- Complex error handling
- Hard to read

**After (using uploader1.py pattern):**
- `upload_single()` method (clean, self-contained)
- Simple retry loop
- Easy to understand

### **2. Better Upload Reliability**

**From uploader1.py:**
- 30-second timeout (was 20s)
- "singleFile" field name (matches API)
- Proper JSON response parsing
- Retry with delays

### **3. Maintained Critical Features**

**Still has:**
- Offline detection
- Auto-retry when online
- Background threading
- Statistics tracking

### **4. Reduced Complexity**

**Removed:**
- Unused PUT mode logic
- Presigner callbacks
- Complex mode switching

**Kept:**
- Simple POST upload
- Retry logic
- Offline handling

## 🧪 How It Works Now

### **Upload Flow:**

```
Background Thread (runs forever):
    ↓
1. Check internet (every 60s)
    ↓
2. Get pending uploads from database
    ↓
3. If no items → Sleep 5s, loop
    ↓
4. If OFFLINE → Log status, sleep 15s, loop
    ↓
5. If ONLINE → Process each item:
    ↓
    For each image:
      ├─→ upload_single(filepath)
      │       ├─→ Validate file exists
      │       ├─→ Check file size
      │       ├─→ Try upload (retry up to 3 times)
      │       │   ├─→ Success → return True
      │       │   └─→ Fail → wait 5s, retry
      │       └─→ Return True/False
      │
      ├─→ If success: mark_uploaded()
      └─→ If failed: mark_failed()
    ↓
6. Sleep 5s (if all ok) or 15s (if had errors)
    ↓
7. Loop back to step 1
```

## ✅ Verification

### **Test 1: Upload Works**

```bash
python app.py
# Press button
# Wait for capture
# Check terminal:
[UPLOADER] Processing 1 pending uploads...
[UPLOADER] ✓ Uploaded: r1_1234567890.jpg
```

### **Test 2: Offline Mode**

```bash
# Disconnect internet
# Press button
# Check terminal:
[UPLOADER] ⚠ Internet connection lost - switching to offline mode
[UPLOADER] Offline - 1 images pending, will retry when online

# Reconnect internet (wait 60s)
[UPLOADER] ✓ Internet connection restored - switching to online mode
[UPLOADER] Processing 1 pending uploads...
[UPLOADER] ✓ Uploaded: r1_1234567890.jpg
```

### **Test 3: Retry Logic**

```bash
# Invalid endpoint in .env
# Press button
# Check terminal:
[UPLOADER] Processing 1 pending uploads...
[UPLOADER] ✗ Upload failed: HTTP 404
[UPLOADER] Retrying in 5s... (attempt 2/3)
[UPLOADER] ✗ Upload failed: HTTP 404
[UPLOADER] Retrying in 5s... (attempt 3/3)
[UPLOADER] ✗ Upload failed: HTTP 404
[UPLOADER] ✗ Giving up on r1_xxx.jpg after 3 attempts
```

## 📝 Configuration

### **In .env file:**

```bash
# Retry configuration (from uploader1.py pattern)
MAX_RETRIES=3       # Number of upload attempts per image
RETRY_DELAY=5       # Seconds to wait between retries

# Offline mode configuration
CONNECTIVITY_CHECK_INTERVAL=60  # Check internet every 60s
```

### **Upload endpoint:**

```bash
# Must match your API's expected field name
UPLOAD_FIELD_NAME=singleFile  # Changed to match uploader1.py

# If your API expects "file" instead:
UPLOAD_FIELD_NAME=file
```
